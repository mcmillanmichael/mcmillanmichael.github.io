##### Software Developer - 2008 to 2011

Here, I was a software developer for both mobile and server side components for [Esay's WorkMobile](http://www.workmobileforms.com) project.

This role involved using C#, Java for Android and blackberry, Windows-Mobile, web-services, sql-server, and agile scrum. Esay provided training to help me fulfil my role, including offsite sql-server and WCF courses, and learning to program for the Android platform.

Here I quickly proved my worth, and my advice was often sought to help work through complex issues.

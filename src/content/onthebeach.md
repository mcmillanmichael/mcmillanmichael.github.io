##### Software Developer - 2019 to present

This was a brand new team comprising of engineers that were strong in either ruby or C# so, we utilized developer pairing to get everyone comfortable reading both languages.  I regularly paired with our QA to teach her javascript and cypress testing, encouraged her to own the testing strategy, and voice any manual testing that she was doing so we can translate it into automated integration tests.

Paired with colleagues from other departments, such as devops, to speed up the delivery of functionality that we needed.

Requirements were not defined from the start, so I arranged regular meetings to gather and refine requirements from stakeholders and other touch-point teams.

Led whiteboard sessions with my team, ironing out what our domain boundaries should encompass, and how we might achieve our agreed north-star.  I identified how we might achieve this end-goal in phases, such that we could continually deliver value to the business.  I also encouraged the team to document any decisions we made in structurizr and to keep the architecture diagram up-to-date.

Took on the role of mentoring a graduate engineer, providing regular feedback and pairing opportunities.  Encouraged them to pair with others on the team to get a well rounded experience.  I also informally mentored everyone on my team by pairing, teaching how to write SOLID code by utilizing IoC and layers of abstraction.

Implemented a CI gitlab pipeline before starting to code, allowing us to build quality code, fast.  This included;
 - a unit test suite for each app that was built with TDD, xunit, auto-fixture, moq-auto-mock, and fluent assertions
 - a no-deployment, integration test suite using cypress, that would test the breadth of our domain

Built a web api from the ground up, with high-throughput performance in mind from the start.

Maintained gitlab repositories and was a quality control, reviewing all changes that went in for code quality and for security implications.

Worked on integrating with ELK, NewRelic and building grafana dashboards, such that we had visibility on how our apps were performing, and how many errors we were getting.  This allowed us to see how our work was making a difference to the business.

Was on the first line support rota where Iâ€™d triage calls from colleagues at the OTB call-center, and escalate where appropriate.

Encouraged all team members to rotate the role of leading standup and retrospective.  Regularly unblocked work on our team by seeking out answers to our unknowns from colleagues on other teams.

Wrote blog posts on the internal OTB blogin site about my experience with gitlab that I thought might be useful to others in the development department.
